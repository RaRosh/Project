1.   |  8/7   |  V1.0      |    Meetup and registration page                      |  Testing the first version of the functionality

1. Introduction
      The Software Test Plan is designed to test the functionality for the Meetup App.
      This app will be used by Admins to create and manage Meetups.
      The objective of the test plan is to identify scope, approach, Functionality/ Features to be tested, resources, schedule,
      testers responsible, risks and change management required for  complete testing cycle.

2. Scope
      Testing will be performed to test the first version of the functionality for the Meetup App
      Testing will be performed to test creation and manage the App by the Admins
      Testing will be performed to test the UI page accessed by Users
      Additional testing will be performed as the product is constructed or changes are made
      Test plan will include test cases for Registration Page Access

   Reference
      Please refer to instructions provided in Quality Assurance Engineer Code Challenge.

3. Approach

      Static Testing : Documentation will be reviewed formally with the entire team and a review report will be prepared to ensure that it is correct and complete.
      White-Box Testing : Unit testing and Integration testing will be done by developers
      Black-Box Testing : System testing and UAT will be done by the testers
      Testing will include Cross browser testing, browser compatibility testing, performance testing, mobile app testing


4. Functionality /Features to be Tested
Features/functionality will be tested as per the requirements
Test Data  will be prepared for Equivalence class partition (Valid/Invalid)
and Boundary Value Analysis(Minimum/Maximum/Size)
Bidirectional Requirement traceability will be maintained for adequate test coverage
Data Accuracy will be tested
